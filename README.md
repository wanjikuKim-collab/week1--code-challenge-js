# Week1 Code Challenge

## Goals

To create a:
- Student Grade Generator 
- Speed Detector
- Net Salary Calculator

# Introduction
As developers, it's important to bridge the gap between theory and practical skills. With these weekly challenge we're able to combine `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS` concepts in executing the above challenges.

## Student Grade Generator 
This is a mini-project that allows users to input marks between 0 and 100. Afterwhich it generates the appropriate grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.


## Speed Detector

In this mini-project, I've created a Speed Detector dashboard that takes in the speed of a car in km/s as the input.Our speed limit is 70km/s. Based on the input speed, it outputs an `OK` if `the speed is less than 70`; and for `every 5km/s above the speed limit`, it gives the driver `one demerit point` and `prints the total number of demerit points` e.g if the speed is 100km/s it prints : “Points: 6”

If the driver gets more than 12 points, the output prinyed is: “License suspended”.


## Net Salary Calculator
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, this calculator calculates the following: the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions 
and net salary.

- Basic salary is the amount that an individual receives prior to any extras being added or payments deducted.
- Net salary is what an employee takes home after adding allowances and subtracting the required deductions.
    `Net salary = Gross Salary - Deductions `
-   `Gross Salary = basic Sallary + Allowances`
